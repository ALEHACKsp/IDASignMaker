PCF stands for parsecoff.

It has the same purpose and the same switches as parselib (plb) so please
look at plb.txt for information. The only additional switch is

	-g...

which changes the COFF magic number.
The COFF magic number appears at the start of a COFF file, the first 2 bytes.
By default the magic number is 0514 octal which corresponds to IBM PC COFF files.
Parsecoff will recognize file as a COFF file if it starts with the specified magic or with 0.

Parsecoff can handle separate COFF files and AR libraries.
